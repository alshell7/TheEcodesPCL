<blockquote>
<p><em>First of all, if you are unaware what is E code ?</em>
<em>E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland.
The "E" stands for "Europe". They are commonly found on food labels throughout the European Union.
Safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority.</em>
<em>Having a single unified list for food additives was first agreed upon in 1962 with food colouring. 
In 1964, the directives for preservatives were added, 1970 for antioxidants and 1974 for the emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents.</em>
(yeah thats Wiki saying:P, just to give an overview what this library is based on. You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number">visit here</a> for more information on this..)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Portable class library to help you get to work on E codes for any kind food integrity stuff in your app <g-emoji alias="fork_and_knife" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f374.png">üç¥</g-emoji>.
For instance you could have an extra feature in your any food related app to get your client know you even facilitate providing about the food integrity.
Or something like if you're building or promoting a food hygiene type app, this library should add some extra flavor.</p>

<p>This library is written in <em>C#</em>, and considered to be working for platforms like .NET, Windows Phone,.etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The targeted framework includes .NET framework 4.0 and higher, SilverLight 5, Windows Phone 8, Windows Store Apps (Windows 8),
Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.iOS (classic)</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] More samples, for different platforms</li>
<li>[ ] Extra information on the E codes</li>
<li>[ ] Support for Android and Java client apps.</li>
<li>[ ] Hopefully to have an API service built out of this library <g-emoji alias="sparkles" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png">‚ú®</g-emoji>
